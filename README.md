## How to use it
*Update: You can watch my tutorial here: https://youtu.be/aFrvoFE7r_g*

### Quick Start (Recommended)
The easiest way to run the game is using the automated scripts that handle everything for you:

**For Windows:**
```
./scripts/run.ps1
```

**For Linux/macOS:**
```
chmod +x ./scripts/run.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

These scripts will automatically:
- Create a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Install all required dependencies
- Run the game with automatic restart on crashes
- Exit cleanly when you close the game window

### Manual Setup (Advanced Users)
If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. If you don't, follow the instructions from the official [python website](http://python.org/downloads/)
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/macOS:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```
   python ./src/main.py
   ```

### Configuration (Optional)
1. Make a copy of `default.config.json` to `config.json` or run the game once to automatically copy the config file into `config.json`
2. Create your Google API Key for YouTube.
3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your Google Cloud Project.
4. Enter your credentials in the configuration file.
5. Set your youtube channel id and livestream id in the configuration file.
6. Change configuration to your liking

**Note:** The automated scripts (`run.ps1` and `run.sh`) will run the game and restart it in case of unexpected crashes. When you close the game window normally, the script will exit cleanly. This is perfect for unattended streams.

Steps 2 to 6 are **optional**. You can disable the entire YouTube integration by setting the property: `"CHAT_CONTROL": false`

### Available chat commands
```
# Explosive Commands
tnt          - Spawn TNT explosions
megatnt      - Spawn massive TNT (subscriber rewards)

# Speed Controls  
fast         - Speed up pickaxe movement
slow         - Slow down pickaxe movement

# Size Controls
big          - Enlarge the pickaxe temporarily

# Pickaxe Materials
